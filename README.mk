This repo is meant to make generic modules for the Chariot Project. Modules will use primarily USB (2.0 and later 3.0) interfaces to communicate with one another.

The key goals for a Mk1 MVP would include:
	- A module ICD for USB communications
	- Libraries in the target language (most likely C, maybe Rust if I'm feeling adventurous) implmenting the ICD
	- Successful USB communication
	- Supporting documentation, dev logs, and reports
